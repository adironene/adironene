## Title

Map API choice for interactive maps on website

## Status

Accepted

## Context

**Background Information**

- I would like to build a webpage that displays food reviews that show as waypoints on a map. I need an interactive map library because it will be a lot of work to build from scratch at first
  **Goals**
- display waypoints on map
- be able to zoom in and out on map
- be able to drag to different areas of the map
  **Assumptions**
- the api library will be around for the next few years

## Decision

I decided to use [felt](https://felt.com/) for now. I will look into building on own map API in a few years if I have nothing in the backlog.

## Alternatives Considered

**[zeemaps](https://www.zeemaps.com/blog/)**

- zeemaps has an upload limit of 100 per map for the free version
- also, there may be generated ads on the map

**[felt](https://felt.com/)**

- free plan for basic features, which should suffice for my project

**[mapme](https://mapme.com/)**

- free for first 5 maps but $24 / month after

**[leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)**

- an open source js library
- Has pretty limited options but is a good place to start
